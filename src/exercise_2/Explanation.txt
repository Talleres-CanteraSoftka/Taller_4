    Is it possible to run a java program that contains multiple classes with main methods?
    If yes, how is the entry point to a program determined?

    Answer:

    yes is possible, this whole project was created to show this possibility.

    First there is one condition for this to work, each main method has to be in a different class,
    you can include many main methods in the same one.

    The execution of the desired main method varies from IDE to IDE for example in Intellij is as simple as going
    to the Run menu and selecting the option " Run..." then you can select the main method from the class you want to run,
    the name of the class is not important, for example in this project there are many Main classes with a main method and
    is possible to run all of them with those steps.

    To change the main class that is being used in Neatbeans, go to the File menu and choose Project Properties.
    This dialog offers all the options that can be changed in a NetBeans project.
    Click the Run category. On this page, there is a main class option. Currently, it is set to Main (the Main.java class).
    Clicking the Browse button on the right will bring up a popup with all the parent classes that are in the  project.
    Choose the class you want to run. Click OK on the Project Properties dialog.

    As shown is possible to run a java program that contains multiple classes with main methods, but the previous solutions
    only work in a program that is still in production since they need the use of an IDE.
