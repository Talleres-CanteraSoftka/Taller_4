# OOP exercises and object modeling

This reporistory contains the solution to the following exercises:

### Exercise 1
Develop a class in Java that performs the abstraction of a planetary system, taking into account for each body of the system aspects such as: mass, density, diameter, distance from the sun (suppose circular orbits), a unique identifier number and a textual name . Include methods that calculate the gravitational attraction between any two bodies in the system.

### Exercise 2
Is it possible to run a java program that contains multiple classes with main methods? If yes, how is the entry point to a program determined?

#### Exercise 3
Write a java program that randomly generates (Hint: See Math class for how to generate random numbers in java) an array of real numbers, and sorts it using the bubble algorithm or quick sort (this should be user selectable) ).

#### Exercise 4
You want to implement the control of a Ferry. To do this, create a Vehicle class. Include aspects common to all vehicles such as number of passengers, presence or absence of crew, number of wheels, registration date, means of travel, etc. Include the methods you consider appropriate. Make a program capable of reading the data of 10 vehicles from the keyboard and list them on the screen.

### Exercise 5
Starting from the previous class, and through inheritance, create new classes that allow you to differentiate whether the object is a car, a motorcycle, a truck, a bicycle, or a boat. Include in each class some specific attribute that differentiates it from the others. For example, for the car a boolean that determines if it has three or five doors, for the truck the height (regardless of the other vehicles), etc. Carry out a program like the one in the previous exercise capable of working with the different types of vehicles.

#### Exercise #6
An interesting predefined class in the java language is the Vector class, which implements the "dynamic array" abstraction. Review the class and use it (in different files) to make a program that reads numbers from the keyboard until the same number is entered twice in a row. Then the program shows all the entered numbers and ends.

### IMPORTANT

Remember to select which one is the class with the main method  you want to run to see each of the exercises working. You can check exercise 2 for a longer explanation
